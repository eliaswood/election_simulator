This project seeks to simulate and visualize elections in ["first passed the post"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) systems. Especially an effect of these systems known as [Duverger's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger's_law), where, given enough time, FPTP systems tend to converge to effectively only two political parties.

Long story short, if you believe that voters act rationally, then, according to the math, FPTP guarantees your democracy will descend into an us/then flamewar.

### Special Thanks
This project was largely inspired by ["Politics in the Animal Kingdom"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo&list=PL7679C7ACE93A5638) and [Nicky Case's](https://ncase.me/) fantastic ["the evolution of trust"](https://ncase.me/trust/).

### Installation
Make sure you have a recent version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (this app was written with v8.11.2), then run `npm install`.

### Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
so the usual suspects work:
- `npm start` to start the development server
- `npm test` to start the test runner
- `npm build` to build the production site
